# MathGame
this is a math game. You'll pick the operation, and an extra operation if you want. Then, follow as prompted. 
for the first two prompts, pick 0, +, -, *, /.
For the following, enter an integer ,and -999 to quit, 999 to see score. (I coulda done some throw exception stuff but i was too lazy)

Instructions:
1. Start program
2. Enter as prompted. (dont enter anything else, I was too lazy to add validation there)
3. Enter as prompted again. (this one has validation so knock yourself out.)
4. Enter as prompted as many times as you want. (Only one chance per question!)


Interesting features: 
I was able to add an option to add an extra operations, and that follows order of operations. 
Division will also always give a whole number (Idea thanks to Aithy)
I would write more, but thats it lol
